## About The Project

A social media app designed for teachers within school districts to stay interconnected with each other. Teachers will have the ability to create group chats by subject, department, grade levels, or clubs, individually message other teachers, and create posts on the teacher feed page. 

Additionally, this feature provides a smart calendar tool that enables teachers to detect exam overloads, and prompts teachers to coordinate test dates, ensuring students aren't overwhelmed by multiple exams on a single day. Our goal is to improve communication, enhance organization, and create a centralized hub for teachers to support one another.
